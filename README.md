## **Motivation**
In today's regulatory landscape, ensuring compliance with data protection laws such as GDPR and the California Privacy Act (CPA) is crucial for businesses. Our capstone project, Karna, addresses this challenge by offering a sophisticated AI-powered chatbot designed to analyze code against legal standards and provide actionable compliance insights.

## **Introducing Karna**
Karna is an advanced AI model tailored for predictive analytics in compliance checking. It allows users to upload their code, which Karna then evaluates against its knowledge base of GDPR, CPA, and other legal documents. The chatbot identifies non-compliant sections of the code and references the specific legal clauses where the issues arise.

## **Data Background**
To ensure Karna's effectiveness, we curated a comprehensive dataset comprising GDPR, CPA, and related legal texts. This dataset was meticulously preprocessed to facilitate accurate analysis and compliance checking.

## **Model Training**
Training Karna involved:
1. **Data Processing:** Preparing legal texts and code snippets for comparative analysis.
2. **Knowledge Extraction:** Extracting key compliance rules and regulations from legal documents.
3. **Model Development:** Building algorithms to interpret and match code against compliance standards.
4. **Validation:** Validating the model's accuracy and reliability in compliance checking scenarios.

Detailed methodologies and scripts for training Karna are available in the `training` directory.

## **Model Inference**
Karna's inference capabilities allow it to analyze new code submissions in real-time. Users receive immediate feedback on compliance status and actionable insights on necessary modifications.

## **Model Testing**
We rigorously tested Karna using metrics tailored to compliance checking, ensuring robust performance across various code samples and legal frameworks. Test results and evaluation scripts can be accessed in the `testing` directory.

## **User Experience (UX)**
Karna offers an intuitive user interface designed for data scientists and developers. It supports interactive sessions where users can query specific legal clauses or receive guidance on compliance issues related to GDPR, CPA, and other regulations. Setup instructions and UX documentation are provided in the `UX` directory.

## **Key Risks and Future Work**
While Karna represents a significant advancement, ongoing challenges include adapting to evolving legal standards and expanding its knowledge base to cover additional regulations. Future work will focus on:
- Enhancing real-time compliance checking capabilities.
- Integrating more legal frameworks and updates.
- Improving user feedback mechanisms based on interaction data.
